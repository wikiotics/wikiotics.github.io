# Wikiotics media

This repository contains all media elements behind the [Wikiotics](https://wikiotics.org) site.  The lesson media contained here is multiple gigabytes of data.  If these files were contained directly in the main repository, it would be unwieldy to work with.

The content in this repository is all freely licensed.  To see the precise license and attribution information for a given piece of media, e.g. `sha386/<hash>.ext`, run

```
$ git clone https://github.com/wikiotics/wikiotics.org.git
$ cd wikiotics.org
$ git log -S<hash>
$ git show <resulting commit id>
